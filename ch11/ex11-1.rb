# The game of Go is often played online. Many users save their game data for 
# later analysis. The game is played by two players who take turns placing 
# stones (one player using black stones and the other using white stones) on X
# the intersections of a 19 Ã— 19 board. Create a program to enter each move of 
# a game and save that information to a file.
